This is a Python package with command-line utilities and scripts to aid the development 
of machine learning models for Silicon Lab's embedded platforms.

The features of this Python package include:
- [Command-line](./docs/command_line/index.md) - Execute all ML operations from a simple command-line interface
- [Python API](./docs/python_api/index.md) - Execute all ML operations from a Python script
- [Model Profiler](./docs/guides/model_profiler.md) - Determine how efficiently an ML model will execute on an embedded platform
- [Model Training](./docs/guides/model_training.md) - Train an ML model using [Google Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [Remote Training via SSH](./docs/guides/model_training_via_ssh.md) - Securely and seamlessly train the model on a remote "cloud" machine
- [Model Training Monitor](./docs/guides/model_training_monitor.md) - Monitor/profile the training of a model using [Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard)
- [Model Evaluation](./docs/guides/model_evaluation.md) - Evaluate a trained ML model's accuracy and other metrics
- [Model Summary](./docs/guides/model_summary.md) - Generate a summary of the model's contents
- [Model Visualization](./docs/guides/model_visualizer.md) - Interactively view the ML model's structure 
- [Model Quantization](./docs/guides/model_quantization.md) - Reduce the memory footprint of an ML model by using the [Tensorflow-Lite Converter](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/convert)
- [Model Parameters](./docs/guides/model_parameters.md) - Embed custom parameters into the generated model file
- [Audio Feature Generator](./docs/audio/audio_feature_generator.md) - Library and tools to convert streaming audio into spectrograms
- [Audio Utilities](./docs/audio/audio_utilities.md) - Utilities to aid the development of audio classification models
- [C++ Python Wrappers](./docs/cpp_development/wrappers/index.md) - Enable sharing source code between embedded targets and model training scripts


Refer to [Why MLTK?](./docs/why_mltk.md) for more details on the benefits of using the MLTK.

```{hint} 
Just want to quickly profile a model to see how fast it can run on an embedded target?

## Installation

Install the pre-built Python package:

```{eval-rst}
.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Windows

      .. code-block:: shell

         pip  install silabs-mltk

   .. tab-item:: Linux

      .. code-block:: shell

         pip3 install silabs-mltk

```


Or, build and install the Python package from [Github](https://github.com/siliconlabs/mltk):

```{eval-rst}
.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Windows

      .. code-block:: shell

         pip  install git+https://github.com/siliconlabs/mltk.git

   .. tab-item:: Linux

      .. code-block:: shell

         pip3 install git+https://github.com/siliconlabs/mltk.git
```

Refer to the [Installation Guide](./docs/installation.md) for more details on how to install the MLTK.
