- [Keyword Spotting - On/Off](../mltk/tutorials/keyword_spotting_on_off) - Develop an ML model to detect the keywords: "on" or "off"
- [Model Optimization for MVP Hardware Accelerator](../mltk/tutorials/model_optimization) - Use the various MLTK tools to optimize a model to fit within an embedded device's resource constraints
- [Keyword Spotting with Transfer Learning](../mltk/tutorials/keyword_spotting_with_transfer_learning) - Use a pre-trained model to quickly train a new model that detects the keywords: "one", "two", "three", "four"
- [ONNX to TF-Lite Model Conversion](../mltk/tutorials/onnx_to_tflite) - Describes how to convert an [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) formatted model file to the `.tflite` model format required by embedded targets
