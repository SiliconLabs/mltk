    "# Cloud Logging with Weights & Biases\n",

    "\n",

    "This tutorial describes how to log the information generated during model development to the cloud.\n",

    "While many 3rd-party cloud solutions are available, this tutorial uses [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai):\n",

    "\n",

    "> Weights & Biases makes it easy to track your experiments, manage & version your data, and collaborate with your team so you can focus on building the best models.\n",

    "\n",

    "This has the following benefits:\n",

    "- All model development files (trained model files, evaluation results, etc.) are saved to the cloud\n",

    "- Graphical interface for comparing different training runs\n",

    "- Sort training runs by custom configuration values to see which has the most benefit\n",

    "- View model training status from anywhere \n",

    "- Email alerts for when model training completes\n",

    "- Automatically generate model report (interactive webpage or PDF)\n",

    "- Monitor GPU and CPU usage during model training\n",

    "## Basic Usage\n",

    "\n",

    "The basic flow for logging information to the cloud is as follows:\n",

    "\n",

    "1. Create a Weights & Biases [account](https://app.wandb.ai/login?signup=true)\n",

    "2. Install the MLTK, see the [Installation Guide](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/installation.html#standard-python-package):  \n",

    "   ```shell\n",

    "   pip install silabs-mltk\n",

    "   ```\n",

    "\n",

    "3. Install the [Weights & Biases](https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart) python package:   \n",

    "   ```shell\n",

    "   pip install wandb\n",

    "   ```\n",

    "4. Log into your wandb account using the command:  \n",

    "   ```shell\n",

    "   wandb login\n",

    "   ```\n",

    "5. Define your MLTK [model specification]() and extend the [WeightsAndBiasesMixin](../../docs/python_api/mltk_model/weights_and_biases_mixin.md), e.g.:  \n",

    "\n",

    "   ```python\n",

    "   import mltk.core as mltk_core\n",

    "\n",

    "   class MyModel(\n",

    "      mltk_core.MltkModel,\n",

    "      mltk_core.TrainMixin,\n",

    "      mltk_core.DatasetMixin,\n",

    "      mltk_core.EvaluateClassifierMixin,\n",

    "      mltk_core.WeightsAndBiasesMixin\n",

    "   ):\n",

    "      pass\n",

    "   my_model = MyModel()\n",

    "   ```\n",

    "6. [Train](../../docs/guides/model_training.md) your model with the command:  \n",

    "   ```shell\n",

    "   mltk train <model name> --post\n",

    "   ```\n",

    "   Where `--post` tells the MLTK to enable the [WeightsAndBiasesMixin](../../docs/python_api/mltk_model/weights_and_biases_mixin.md)\n",

    "7. Optionally [profile](../../docs/guides/model_profiler.md) your model with the command:    \n",

    "   ```shell\n",

    "   mltk profile <model name> --accelerator mvp --device --post\n",

    "   ```\n",

    "   Where `--post` tells the MLTK to enable the [WeightsAndBiasesMixin](../../docs/python_api/mltk_model/weights_and_biases_mixin.md)\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",

    "That's it! This will train (and optionally profile) the model and all relevant information will automatically be logged to the [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai) cloud."

    "## Logging Information\n",

    "\n",

    "The [WeightsAndBiasesMixin](../../docs/python_api/mltk_model/weights_and_biases_mixin.md) manages all of the details of initializing the wandb session and automatically logging the relavant information to the cloud.\n",

    "\n",

    "### Default Data\n",

    "\n",

    "By default, the following information is logged to the cloud:\n",

    "\n",

    "- [Model specification](../../docs/guides/model_specification.md) - The Python script that defines your model\n",

    "- [Model archive](../../docs/guides/model_archive.md) - ZIP file containing the trained model files \n",

    "- [Model summary](../../docs/guides/model_summary.md) - Basic informaation about the model\n",

    "- Dataset summary - Basic information about the dataset used for training and evaluation\n",

    "- [Training history](https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/python/integrations/keras/wandbcallback) - Learn rate, accuracy, loss, etc.\n",

    "- [Evaluation results](../../docs/guides/model_evaluation.md) - Precision, recall, ROC, etc.\n",

    "- [Profiling results](../../docs/guides/model_profiler.md) - Inference/s, RAM and flash usage, etc.\n",

    "- System usage - GPU, CPU, disk, memory utilization, etc.\n",

    "\n",

    "### Custom Data\n",

    "\n",

    "Any custom data can also be stored in the cloud using:\n",

    "- [WeightsAndBiasesMixin.wandb_log()](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/python_api/mltk_model/weights_and_biases_mixin.html#mltk.core.WeightsAndBiasesMixin.wandb_log) - post custom logging information\n",

    "- [WeightsAndBiasesMixin.wandb_save()](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/python_api/mltk_model/weights_and_biases_mixin.html#mltk.core.WeightsAndBiasesMixin.wandb_save) - upload a file\n",

    "\n",

    "Internally, these APIs call the wandb APIs:\n",

    "- [wandb.log()](https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/python/log)\n",

    "- [wandb.save()](https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/python/save)\n"

    "## Training and logging in the cloud\n",

    "\n",

    "The MLTK supports training via [SSH](../../docs/guides/model_training_via_ssh.md).\n",

    "This feature allows for model training in the cloud which can greatly reduce model training time.  \n",

    "See the [Cloud Training via vast.ai](../../mltk/tutorials/cloud_training_with_vast_ai.md) tutorial for more details.\n",

    "\n",

    "The following is needed to enable logging to [Weight & Biases](https://wandb.ai) while training in the cloud:\n",

    "\n",

    "1. Obtain your wandb [API Key](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/dagster#how-to-get-an-api-key):  \n",

    "   a. [Log in to W&B](https://wandb.ai/login)  \n",

    "   b. Collect your API key by navigating to the [authorization page](https://wandb.ai/authorize)\n",

    "2. Create/modify the [~/.mltk/user_settings.yaml](../../docs/other/settings_file.md) file and add:  \n",

    "   ```yaml\n",

    "   ssh:\n",

    "      startup_cmds:\n",

    "      - pip install wandb plotly\n",

    "      - wandb login <API KEY> \n",

    "   ```\n",

    "   where `<API KEY>` is your API key from step 1\n",

    "\n",

    "That's it! When you model trains on the cloud machine, it will also log to the Weights & Biases cloud.  \n",

    "This is especially useful when used in conjunction with the [Alerts](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/alert) feature of W&B so you can be notified when training completes."

    "## Other Features\n",

    "\n",

    "The Weights & Biases [documentation](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides) describes many useful features.\n",

    "\n",

    "Some of the more useful features include:\n",

    "\n",

    "- [Collaborative Reports](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/reports) - Reports let you organize, embed and automate visualizations, describe your findings, share updates with collaborators, and more.\n",

    "- [Alerts](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/alert) - Send alerts, triggered from your Python code, to your Slack or email\n",

    "- [Storing Artifacts](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts) -  track datasets, models, dependencies, and results through each step of your machine learning pipeline. Artifacts make it easy to get a complete and auditable history of changes to your files."
