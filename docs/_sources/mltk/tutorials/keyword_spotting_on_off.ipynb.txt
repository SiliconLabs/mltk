    "## Dataset Selection and Preprocessing Parameters\n",

    "\n",

    "Before starting the actual tutorial, let's first discuss datasets.\n",

    "\n",

    "### TL;DR  \n",

    "\n",

    "1. A _representative_ dataset must be acquired for the trained model to perform well in the real-world\n",

    "2. The dataset should (typically) be transformed so that the model can efficiently learn the features of the dataset\n",

    "3. Whatever transformations are used must be identical at training-time on the PC and run-time on the embedded device\n",

    "4. The size of the dataset can be effectively increased by randomly augmenting it during training (changing the pitch, speed, adding background noise, etc.)\n",

    "\n",

    "### Acquire a Representative Dataset\n",

    "\n",

    "The most critical aspect of any machine learning model is the dataset. A _representative_ dataset is necessary to train a robust model.\n",

    "A model that is trained on a dataset that is too small and/or not representative of what would be seen in the real-world will likely not perform well.\n",

    "\n",

    "In this tutorial, we want to create a keyword spotting classification machine learning model. This implies the following about the dataset:  \n",

    "- The dataset must contain audio samples of the keywords we want to detect\n",

    "- The dataset must be labelled, i.e. each sample in the dataset must have an associated \"class\", e.g. \"on\", \"off\"\n",

    "- The dataset must be relatively large and representative to account for the variance in spoken language (accents, background noise, etc.) \n",

    "\n",

    "For this tutorial, we'll use the [Google Speech Commands v2](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/speech_commands) dataset\n",

    "(__NOTE:__ This dataset is automatically downloaded in a later step in this tutorial).  \n",

    "This dataset is effectively a directory of sub-directories, and each sub-directory contains thousands of 1s audio clips.\n",

    "The name of each sub-directory corresponds to the word being spoken in the audio clip, e.g:\n",

    "\n",

    "```console\n",

    "/dataset\n",

    "/dataset/on\n",

    "/dataset/on/sample1.wav\n",

    "/dataset/on/sample2.wav\n",

    "...\n",

    "/dataset/off\n",

    "/dataset/off/sample1.wav\n",

    "/dataset/off/sample2.wav\n",

    "...\n",

    "```\n",

    "\n",

    "So this dataset meets our requirements:  \n",

    "- It contains audio samples of the keywords we want to detect (\"on\", \"off\")\n",

    "- The samples are labelled (all \"on\" samples are in the \"on\" sub-directory etc.)\n",

    "- The dataset is representative (the audio clips are taken from many different people saying the same words)\n",

    "\n",

    "__NOTE:__ For many machine learning applications acquiring a dataset will not be so easy. \n",

    "Many times the dataset will suffer from one or more of the following:\n",

    "- The dataset does not exist - Need to manually collect samples\n",

    "- The raw samples exist but are not \"labeled\" - Need to manually group the samples\n",

    "- The dataset is \"dirty\" - Bad/corrupt samples, mislabeled samples\n",

    "- The dataset is not representative - Duplicate/similar samples, not diverse enough to cover the possible range seen in the real-world\n",

    "\n",

    "__NOTE:__ A clean, representative dataset is one of the best ways to train a robust model.\n",

    "It is _highly_ recommended to invest the time/energy to create a good dataset!\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",

    "### Feature Engineering\n",

    "\n",

    "Along with a representative dataset, we (usually) need to transform the individual samples of the dataset\n",

    "so that the machine learning model can efficiently learn the \"features\" of the dataset, and thus make accurate predictions. \n",

    "This process is frequently called \"feature engineering\". One way of describing feature engineering is: \n",

    "Use human insight to amplify the signals of the dataset so that a machine can more efficiently learn the patterns in it.\n",

    "\n",

    "The transform(s) used for feature engineering are highly application-specific.\n",

    "\n",

    "For this tutorial, we use the common technique of converting the raw audio into a spectrogram (i.e. gray-scale image).\n",

    "The machine learning model then learns the patterns in the spectrogram images that correspond to the keywords in the audio samples.\n",

    "\n",

    "### Featuring Engineering on the Edge\n",

    "\n",

    "An important aspect to keep in mind about the transform(s) chosen for featuring engineering \n",

    "is that whatever is done to the dataset samples during training must also be\n",

    "done on the embedded device at run-time. i.e. The _exact_ algorithms used to generate the\n",

    "spectrogram on the PC during training _must_ be used on the embedded device at run-time.\n",

    "Any divergence will cause the embedded model to \"see\" different samples and likely not perform well (if at all).\n",

    "\n",

    "For this purpose, the MLTK offers an [Audio Feature Generator](../../docs/audio/audio_feature_generator.md) component. \n",

    "This component generates spectrograms from raw audio. The algorithms used in this component are accessible via:\n",

    "\n",

    "- MLTK [Python API](../../docs/python_api/data_preprocessing/audio_feature_generator.md)\n",

    "- Gecko SDK [firmware component](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/audio/audio_feature_generator.html#gecko-sdk-component)\n",

    "\n",

    "In this way, the _exact_ spectrogram generation algorithms used during training may also be used at\n",

    "run-time on the embedded device.\n",

    "\n",

    "Refer to the  [Audio Feature Generator](../../docs/audio/audio_feature_generator.md) documentation\n",

    "and [Audio Visualization](#audio-visualization) section for more details on how the various parameters used to generate the spectrogram may be determined.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",

    "### Data Augmentation\n",

    "\n",

    "A useful technique for expanding the size of a dataset (and hopefully making it more representative) is to apply random augmentations to the training samples.\n",

    "For instance, audio dataset augmentations might include:\n",

    "- Increase/decrease speed\n",

    "- Increase/decrease pitch\n",

    "- Add random background noises\n",

    "\n",

    "In this way, the model never \"sees\" the same sample during training which should hopefully make it robust\n",

    "as it has learned from a larger collection of samples.\n",

    "\n",

    "For this purpose, the MLTK offers an [Audio Data Generator](../../docs/python_api/data_preprocessing/audio_feature_generator.md)\n",

    "Python component. The Audio Data Generator uses the audio dataset as an input and randomly augments\n",

    "the audio samples during training (see the [Model Specification](#model-specification) section below).\n",

    "\n",

    "__NOTE:__ Augmentations are only applied during training. They are not applied at run-time.\n",

    "\n",

    "Refer to the [Audio Visualization](#audio-visualization) section for more details on how the various parameters used to augment the audio may be determined."

    "\n",

    "Models intended for embedded devices are typically \"small\". Thus, while one or more powerful GPUs will certainly improve training times, there is an upper limit to their benefit. Many times, the bottleneck during training comes from the data preprocessing which is usually done on the CPU. i.e. The GPU(s) train the model faster than the CPU(s) can generate the next round of training data.\n",

If all the model predictions match the expected values then the model is 100% accurate, and every wrong prediction decreases the model accuracy, e.g.:\n",

    "2. Extract the `.tflite` model file from the MLTK [Model Archive](../../docs/guides/model_archive.md)\n",

    "When Simplicity Studio builds the project, it finds the `.tflite` model file and generates a C header file which contains a C `uint8_t` array of the binary data in the `.tflite`. The firmware then references the C array and loads it into the [Tensorflow-Lite Micro Interpreter](https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro).\n",
