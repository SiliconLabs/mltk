 Usage: mltk fingerprint_reader [OPTIONS] <model>                              
                                                                               
 View/save fingerprints captured by the fingerprint eader connected to an      
 embedded device.                                                              
 NOTE: A supported embedded device must be locally connected to use this       
 command.                                                                      
 Additionally, an R503 fingerprint module:                                     
 https://www.adafruit.com/product/4651                                         
 must be connected connected to the development board.                         
 Refer to the online documentation for how to connect it to the development:   
 https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/cpp_development/examples/fingerprint_ 
 authenticator.html#hardware-setup

 --generate-dataset    -g               Generate a fingerprint dataset by    
                                        guiding the user through a sequence  
                                        of finger captures and saving to the 
                                        PC.                                  
                                        NOTE: With this option,              
                                        --no-inference is automatically      
                                        enabled                              
 --samples-per-finger  -c      INTEGER  The number of samples per finger to  
                                        collect when generating the dataset  
                                        [default: 5]                         
 --dataset-dir                 TEXT     Base directory where dataset should  
                                        be generated

 --dump-images         -d               Dump the raw images from the device  
                                        fingerprint reader to a directory on 
                                        the local PC.                        
 --no-inference        -z               By default inference is executed on  
                                        the device. Use --no-inference to    
                                        disable inference on the device      
                                        which can improve dumping throughput 
 --app                         <path>   By default, the                      
                                        fingerprint_authenticator app is     
                                        automatically downloaded.            
                                        This option allows for overriding    
                                        with a custom built app.             
                                        Alternatively, set this option to    
                                        "none" to NOT program the            
                                        fingerprint_authenticator app to the 
                                        device.                              
                                        In this case, ONLY the .tflite will  
                                        be programmed and the existing       
                                        fingerprint_authenticator app will   
                                        be re-used.
