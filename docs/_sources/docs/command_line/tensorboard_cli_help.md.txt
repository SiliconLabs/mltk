 In machine learning, to improve something you often need to be able to measure it.                                                                                                                                                                                                            
 TensorBoard is a tool for providing the measurements and visualizations needed during the machine learning workflow.                                                                                                                                                                          
 It enables tracking experiment metrics like loss and accuracy, visualizing the model graph,

 NOTE: The model must be trained (or actively being trained) before using this command.                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 Additionally, the trained model must have the 'tensorboard' property configured.
