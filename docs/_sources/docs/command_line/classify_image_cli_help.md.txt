                                           Longer durations (in milliseconds) will give a higher confidence that the results are correct, but may miss some images

 --threshold        -t      <threshold>    Minimum averaged model output threshold for a class to be considered detected, 0-255. Higher values increase precision at the cost of recall [default: None]

 --sensitivity      -i      FLOAT          Sensitivity of the activity indicator LED. Much less than 1.0 has higher sensitivity [default: None]                                                                                                                                              
 --dump-images      -x                     Dump the raw images from the device camera to a directory on the local PC.                                                                                                                                                                        
                                           NOTE: Use the --no-inference option to ONLY dump images and NOT run inference on the device                                                                                                                                                       
                                           Use the --dump-threshold option to control how unique the images must be to dump                                                                                                                                                                  
 --dump-threshold           FLOAT          This controls how unique the camera images must be before they're dumped.                        [default: 0.1]                                                                                                                                   
                                           This is useful when generating a dataset.                                                                                                                                                                                                         
                                           If this value is set to 0 then every image from the camera is dumped.                                                                                                                                                                             
                                           if this value is closer to 1. then the images from the camera should be sufficiently unique from                                                                                                                                                  
                                           prior images that have been dumped.                                                                                                                                                                                                               
 --no-inference                            By default inference is executed on the device. Use --no-inference to disable inference on the device which can improve image dumping throughput                                                                                                  
 --app                      <path>         By default, the image_classifier app is automatically downloaded.                                        [default: None]                                                                                                                          
                                           This option allows for overriding with a custom built app.                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                           Alternatively, set this option to "none" to NOT program the image_classifier app to the device.                                                                                                                                                   
                                           In this case, ONLY the .tflite will be programmed and the existing image_classifier app will be re-used.
