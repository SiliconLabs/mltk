 Usage: mltk quantize [OPTIONS] <model>                                        
                                                                               
 Quantize a model into a .tflite file                                          
 The model is automatically quantized after training completes.                
 This is useful if the mltk_model.tflite_converter parameters                  
 are modified after the model is trained.
