 Usage: mltk profile [OPTIONS] <model>                                         
                                                                               
 Profile a model to determine how efficiently is may run on hardware           
 This will profile a MLTK model or .tflite model file                          
 in a simulator or on a locally connected, embedded device.                    
                                                                               
 NOTE: *Any* .tflite model file supported by Tensorflow-Lite Micro will        
 work with this command (i.e. The .tflite does NOT need to be generated by the 
 MLTK).
