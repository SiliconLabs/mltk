 --dump-raw-spectrograms  -w                        Dump the raw (i.e. unquantized) generated spectrograms to .jpg images and .mp4 video                                                                                                                                                     
 --dump-spectrograms      -z                        Dump the quantized generated spectrograms to .jpg images and .mp4 video                                                                                                                                                                  
 --sensitivity            -i      FLOAT             Sensitivity of the activity indicator LED. Much less than 1.0 has higher sensitivity [default: None]                                                                                                                                     
 --app                            <path>            By default, the audio_classifier app is automatically downloaded.                                                             [default: None]                                                                                            
                                                    This option allows for overriding with a custom built app.                                                                                                                                                                               
                                                    Alternatively, if using the --device option, set this option to "none" to NOT program the audio_classifier app to the device.                                                                                                            
                                                    In this case, ONLY the .tflite will be programmed and the existing audio_classifier app will be re-used.
