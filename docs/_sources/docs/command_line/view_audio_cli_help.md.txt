 Usage: mltk view_audio [OPTIONS] <model>                                      
                                                                               
 View the spectrograms generated by the AudioFeatureGenerator in real-time     
 NOTE: This command is experimental. Use at your own risk!                     
                                                                               
 This starts a wxPython GUI that allows for viewing the spectrograms generated 
 by the AudioFeatureGenerator in real-time.                                    
 This is useful for determining which AudioFeatureGenerator settings and data  
 augmentation parameters to use with the ParallelAudioDataGenerator.
