# Simplicity Studio Development

This describes how to development C++ applications in the MLTK using Silicon Lab's [Simplicity Studio](https://www.silabs.com/developers/simplicity-studio).  
Using this guide, you can build C++ applications for Silicon Lab's embedded platforms.

__NOTES:__  
- All of the MLTK C++ source code may be found at: [__mltk repo__/cpp](https://github.com/siliconlabs/mltk/tree/master/cpp/)  
- Refer to the [example applications](./examples/index.md) documentation for more details about what comes with the MLTK
- Alternatively, applications may be built for Windows/Linux and embedded targets using [Visual Studio Code](./vscode.md)


```{warning} 
Simplicity Studio __5__ is required to run the MLTK
```


## Install Tools

First, we need to install a few tools:

### 0) Setup OS

```{eval-rst}
.. tabbed:: Windows

   If you're on Windows, enable `long file paths`:
   https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation?tabs=registry

   Also install the Visual Studio C++ compiler (this is needed to build some of the 3rd party Python packages for Python 3.10):
   https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/

   Be sure to check the __Desktop Development with C++__ workload in the installer GUI.

.. tabbed:: Linux

   If you're on Linux, run the following command to install the necessary packages: 

   .. code-block:: shell

      sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
      sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt-get -y install build-essential g++-9 cmake ninja-build gdb p7zip-full git-lfs python3-dev python3-venv libusb-1.0-0 libgl1

```

### 1) Install CMake

CMake is a build system utility used internally by the MLTK.  
Install CMake and ensure it is available on the command `PATH`  
More details here: [https://cmake.org/install](https://cmake.org/install)

### 2) Install 7-Zip

7-Zip is a file archiver with a high compression ratio.  
Several of the assets downloaded by the MLTK are compressed in this format.  
More details here: [https://www.7-zip.org/download.html](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html)

### 3) Install Python

Install Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 _or_ 3.10 64-bit and ensure it is available on the command `PATH`  
More details here: [https://www.python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads)

### 4) Install GIT

If necessary, install Git:  
[https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)


### 5) Install Simplicity Studio 5

Download and install Simplicity Studio __5__:  
[https://www.silabs.com/developers/simplicity-studio](https://www.silabs.com/developers/simplicity-studio)

```{warning} 
Ensure Simplicity Studio is up-to-date before continuing
```


## Install MLTK

Next, we need to install the MLTK:


### 1) Clone the MLTK repository


```shell
# Clone the MLTK GIT repository
git clone https://github.com/siliconlabs/mltk.git
```

Then navigate to the MLTK repository directory

```shell
cd mltk
```


### 2) Run the install script


```{eval-rst}
.. tabbed:: Windows

   .. code-block:: shell

      python .\install_mltk.py

.. tabbed:: Linux

   .. code-block:: shell

      python3 ./install_mltk.py
```


### 3) Activate the MLTK Python virtual environment

Activate the MLTK's Python virtual environment:

```{eval-rst}
.. tabbed:: Windows

   .. code-block:: shell

      .\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

.. tabbed:: Linux

   .. code-block:: shell

      source ./.venv/bin/activate
```


After activation, the `mltk` command should be available on the [command-line](../command_line.md):

```shell
mltk --help
```

## Install the MLTK into the Gecko SDK

The [Gecko SDK](https://github.com/siliconlabs/gecko_sdk) is the main software stack used by Silicon Lab's embedded targets.
The MLTK clones a local copy of the [Gecko SDK](https://github.com/siliconlabs/gecko_sdk) to [__mltk__/cpp/shared/gecko_sdk](https://github.com/siliconlabs/mltk/tree/master/cpp//shared/gecko_sdk).
We need to install the MLTK as an "extension" to the locally cloned Gecko SDK so that the MLTK applications are accessible in Simplicity Studio.

To do this, issue the following command:

```shell
mltk build gsdk_mltk_extension
```

## Add the MLTK Gecko SDK to Simplicity Studio

After building the GSDK MLTK extension, add the locally cloned Gecko SDK at [__mltk__/cpp/shared/gecko_sdk](https://github.com/siliconlabs/mltk/tree/master/cpp//shared/gecko_sdk) to Simplicity Studio.

From Simplicity Studio,  
1. On top toolbar, click: __Window__
2. The click __Preferences__
3. The on the sidebar, expand the __Simplicity Studio__ entry
4. Click the __SDKs__ entry
5. Click the __Add SDK...__ button
6. Populate the __Location__ with the path to the locally cloned GSDK, e.g. `<mltk repo root>/cpp/shared/gecko_sdk/v4.0.2`
7. Click: __OK__
9. If prompted, click the __Trust__ button to "trust" the locally cloned MLTK GSDK
9. Click: __Apply and Close__

At this point, the __MLTK Gecko SDK Suite__ is now available in Simplicity Studio 5.  
From the Launcher, select your connected device, then select the __Preferred SDK__ to be: __MLTK Gecko SDK Suite__  
The MLTK example applications should now be available for project creation.

Refer to the Simplicity Studio 5 [User Guide](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/5.3.0/ss-5-users-guide-overview/)
for more details about building and running projects.

```{hint}
When creating a new project, if you click the __Link to sources__ option, 
then you can directly edit the MLTK C++ sources from Simplicity Studio. Otherwise, the MLTK
C++ sources will be copied to your Simplicity Studio project directory.
```


## Example Applications

Refer to the [Examples Documentation](./examples/index.md) for more details about the applications that come with the MLTK.
