# C++ Development

The MLTK contains both Python scripts _and_ C++ Python wrappers, examples, and libraries:  
- [Python Wrappers](./wrappers/index.md) - Allow for sharing source code between a host PC during model training and an embedded target during model inference
- [Examples](./examples/index.md) - Demonstrate executing the various libraries on the host PC _or_ on an embedded target
- [Libraries](https://github.com/siliconlabs/mltk/tree/master/cpp//shared) - Implement algorithms that are used by the wrappers and examples


## Development Modes

The MLTK supports three modes of C++ development:  
- [Simplicity Studio](./simplicity_studio.md) - Allows for building C++ applications for Silicon Lab's embedded targets using Silicon Lab's Simplicity Studio
- [Visual Studio Code](./vscode.md) - Allows for building C++ applications for Windows/Linux _or_ embedded targets using Microsoft VSCode
- [Command-line](./command_line.md) - Allows for building C++ applications from the command-line using CMake


## Source Code

All of the C++ source code may be found on Github at: [__mltk__/cpp](https://github.com/siliconlabs/mltk/tree/master/cpp/)

This directory has the following structure:  
- [__mltk__/cpp/tflite_micro_wrapper](https://github.com/siliconlabs/mltk/tree/master/cpp//tflite_micro_wrapper) - Tensorflow-Lite Micro Python wrapper, this allows for executing the Tensorflow-Lite Micro interpreter from a Python script
- [__mltk__/cpp/audio_feature_generator_wrapper](https://github.com/siliconlabs/mltk/tree/master/cpp//audio_feature_generator_wrapper) - The AudioFeatureGenerator Python wrapper, this allows for executing the spectrogram generation algorithms from a Python script
- [__mltk__/cpp/mvp_wrapper](https://github.com/siliconlabs/mltk/tree/master/cpp//mvp_wrapper) - MVP hardware accelerator Python wrapper, this allows for executing the MVP-accelerated Tensorflow-Lite Micro kernels from a Python script
- [__mltk__/cpp/shared](https://github.com/siliconlabs/mltk/tree/master/cpp//shared) - All of the C++ libraries and source code
- [__mltk__/cpp/shared/apps](https://github.com/siliconlabs/mltk/tree/master/cpp//shared/apps) - Example applications and demos
- [__mltk__/cpp/shared/platforms](https://github.com/siliconlabs/mltk/tree/master/cpp//shared/platforms) - Supported hardware platforms
- [__mltk__/cpp/tools](https://github.com/siliconlabs/mltk/tree/master/cpp//tools) - Tools used by the C++ build scripts


## Examples

Refer to the [Examples](./examples/index.md) documentation for more details about the applications that come with the MLTK.


## Python Wrappers

Refer to the [C++ Python Wrappers](./wrappers/index.md) documentation for more details about the C++ Python wrappers that come with the MLTK.
