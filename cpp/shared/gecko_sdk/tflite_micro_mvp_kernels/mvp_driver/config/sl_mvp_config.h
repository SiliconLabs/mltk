#ifndef SL_MVP_CONFIG_H
#define SL_MVP_CONFIG_H

// <q SL_MVP_ENABLE_DMA> Use DMA to load MVP programs
// <i> Enable or disable DMA for loading MVP programs.
// <i> Default: 0
#define SL_MVP_ENABLE_DMA  0

// <q SL_MVP_DMA_CHANNEL> DMA channel to used when DMA is enabled
// <i> DMA channel to use when DMA is enabled
// <i> Default: 0
#define SL_MVP_DMA_CHANNEL 0

// <o SL_MVP_POWER_MODE> CPU power mode during MVP execution.
// <i> The power mode configuration controls what software should
// <i> do when waiting for an MVP program to finish execution.
//
// <0=> No sleep
// <1=> Enter EM1
// <2=> Yield RTOS thread
//
// <i> When "No sleep" option is used the MCU core will busy-wait for the MVP
// <i> to finish, this is the option which provides the fastest MVP execution
// <i> time. The "No sleep" option can be used in a bare-metal application or
// <i> an application using RTOS.
// <i> When "Enter EM1" option is used the MCU will be put into EM1 whenever
// <i> the driver waits for an MVP program to complete. The "Enter EM1" option
// <i> is not safe to use in an application using RTOS.
// <i> When "Yield RTOS thread" option is used the task waiting for the MVP
// <i> program to complete will yield, allowing other tasks in the system to
// <i> run or potentially let the scheduler put the system into a sleep mode.
// <i> The "Yield RTOS thread" requires that the application is using RTOS.
// <i> Default: 0
#define SL_MVP_POWER_MODE  1

// <q SL_MVP_OPTIMIZE_SPEED> Enable additional speed optimizations for MVP operations
// <i> By enabling this, the MVP will attempt to optimize select operations
// <i> to run faster, at the expence of increased RAM usage.
// <i> Note: This may increase RAM usage greatly.
// <i> Default: 0
#define SL_MVP_OPTIMIZE_SPEED  0
