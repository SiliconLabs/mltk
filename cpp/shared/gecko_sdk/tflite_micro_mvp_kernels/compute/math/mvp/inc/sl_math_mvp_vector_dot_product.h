/**
 * @brief
 *   Computes the dot product of two vectors.
 *   The vectors are multiplied element-by-element and then summed.
 *
 * @details
 *   All vectors must be of equal length. If all vector buffers are 4-byte
 *   aligned, the function will operate twice as fast using MVP parallel
 *   processing.
 *   Maximum vector length is 1M (2^20), and 2M in the 4-byte aligned case.
 *
 * @note
 *   Depending on the function arguments, the MVP implementation can calculate
 *   the dot product in different ways that may effect the rounding errors.
 *   If the same input vectors are calculated with different memory alignmen,
 *   the results may not be identical.
 *
 * @param[in] input_a Input vector a.
 * @param[in] input_b Input vector b.
 * @param[in] num_elements The number of elements in the input vectors.
 * @param[out] output The result.
 *
 * @return
 *   @ref SL_STATUS_OK on success. On failure, an appropriate sl_status_t
 *   errorcode is returned.
