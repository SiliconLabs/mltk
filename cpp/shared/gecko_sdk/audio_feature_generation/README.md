# Audio Feature Generator

This was taken from the Gecko SDK component: [sl_ml_audio_feature_generation.c](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/gecko_sdk/blob/gsdk_4.0/util/third_party/tensorflow_extra/src/sl_ml_audio_feature_generation.c).

It provides a programming interface to the [Microfrontend](../microfrontend)


## Modifications

It was modified so that it can be built for embedded targets _and_ Windows/Linux. 
It was also modified so that settings can be dynamically loaded at runtime.
