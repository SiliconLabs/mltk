    In machine learning, to improve something you often need to be able to measure it. 
    TensorBoard is a tool for providing the measurements and visualizations needed during the machine learning workflow. 
    It enables tracking experiment metrics like loss and accuracy, visualizing the model graph,
    projecting embeddings to a lower dimensional space, and much more.
    \b
    For more details, see:
    https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/get_started
    https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/guides/model_training_monitor
    \b
    NOTE: The model must be trained (or actively being trained) before using this command.
    Additionally, the trained model must have the 'tensorboard' property configured.
    e.g.:
    my_model.tensorboard = dict(
        histogram_freq=1,       # frequency (in epochs) at which to compute activation and weight histograms 
                                # for the layers of the model. If set to 0, histograms won't be computed. 
                                # Validation data (or split) must be specified for histogram visualizations.
        write_graph=True,       # whether to visualize the graph in TensorBoard. The log file can become quite large when write_graph is set to True.
        write_images=False,     # whether to write model weights to visualize as image in TensorBoard.
        update_freq="epoch",    # 'batch' or 'epoch' or integer. When using 'batch', writes the losses and metrics 
                                # to TensorBoard after each batch. The same applies for 'epoch'. 
                                # If using an integer, let's say 1000, the callback will write the metrics and losses 
                                # to TensorBoard every 1000 batches. Note that writing too frequently to 
                                # TensorBoard can slow down your training.
        profile_batch=2,        # Profile the batch(es) to sample compute characteristics. 
                                # profile_batch must be a non-negative integer or a tuple of integers. 
                                # A pair of positive integers signify a range of batches to profile. 
                                # By default, it will profile the second batch. Set profile_batch=0 to disable profiling.
