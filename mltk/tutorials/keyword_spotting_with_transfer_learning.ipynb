    "## Basic Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "Before continuing, it helps to understand the basic idea of how a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) works.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following diagram illustrates a typical CNN model:  \n",
    "![CNN Diagram](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Typical_cnn.png)  \n",
    "(By Aphex34 - Own work, [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=45679374))\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic parts:  \n",
    "- __Feature Extraction__ - Convolutional filters extract meaningful information (e.g. lines, shapes, textures, colors) from the input image. Multiple layers of filters are used to convert the raw image into a more abstract and compressed representation\n",
    "- __Classifier__ - The final Convolutional layer is feed into a Fully Connected layer. The Fully Connected layer converts the abstract, compressed representation generated by the Convolutional layers into a probability distribution of the possible \"class\" or object type (e.g. dog, cat, fish) to which the input image belongs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(Of course, it can get way more complex than this, but that is basically what is going on).\n",
    "\n",
    "So how does the CNN model learn to extract the features and generate the probability distribution?  \n",
    "Each \"layer\" of the model has \"trainable\" parameters such as weights and filters. Initially, these weights and filters are set to [random values](https://keras.io/api/layers/initializers/).\n",
    "During model training, the weights and filters are adjusted so that the model's predictions are as accurate as possible for the given parameters and dataset.\n",
    "At the end of training, the weights and filters that gave the best predictions are saved to a file and ultimately programmed to the embedded device.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the weights and filters are initially random, it can take a long time to train a model from scratch.  \n",
    "The idea behind transfer learning is to train a new model starting with the best weights and filters of a previously trained model. \n",
    "If the datasets are similar then the new model does not need to relearn how to extract the features (e.g. lines, shapes, textures, colors).  \n",
    "It just needs to learn how to map the abstract, compressed representation of the convolutional layers to the new \"classes\" or objects (e.g. car, truck, bike)."
