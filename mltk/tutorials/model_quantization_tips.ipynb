    "# Model Quantization Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides several tips for how to better quantize your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model quantization uses the [TfliteConverter](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/convert) to convert a model with **float32** tensors into a model with **int8** tensors. A model with **int8** tensors typically reduces the memory requirements by 4x and also allows for better [hardware acceleration](https://docs.silabs.com/gecko-platform/4.2/machine-learning/tensorflow/mvp-accelerator).\n",
    "\n",
    "While model quantization can greatly reduce memory and computational overhead, it can also reduce model accuracy. This is because converting from __float32__ (32-bits) to __int8__ (8-bits) looses information. So, for quantization to be effective, it must accurately represent the original 32-bit data in 8-bits as efficiently as possible. While the [TfliteConverter](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/convert) does most of the work for you, the following provides some tips on how you can help the model quantize even better."

    "## Quantization Report\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensorflow-Lite comes with an experimental [Quantization Debugger](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/quantization_debugger):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Although full-integer quantization provides improved model size and latency, the quantized model won't always work as expected. It's usually expected for the model quality (e.g. accuracy, mAP, WER) to be slightly lower than the original float model. However, there are cases where the model quality can go below your expectation or generated completely wrong results.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> When this problem happens, it's tricky and painful to spot the root cause of the quantization error, and it's even more difficult to fix the quantization error. To assist this model inspection process, quantization debugger can be used to identify problematic layers, and selective quantization can leave those problematic layers in float so that the model accuracy can be recovered at the cost of reduced benefit from quantization.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Quantization debugger makes it possible to do quantization quality metric analysis in the existing model. Quantization debugger can automate processes for running model with a debug dataset, and collecting quantization quality metrics for each tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enabling the Quantization Report\n",
    "\n",
    "The MLTK will automatically generate a quantization report during [model quantization](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/guides/model_quantization.html) by setting the [tflite_converter](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/python_api/mltk_model/train_mixin.html#mltk.core.TrainMixin.tflite_converter) setting:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_model.tflite_converter['generate_quantization_report'] = True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantization report is a standard `.csv` file and is added to the [Model Archive](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/guides/model_archive.html) file (it is also generated in the same directory as the `.tflite`, typically `~/.mtlk/models/<model name>/quantization_report.csv`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analyzing the Report\n",
    "\n",
    "For each row in the report, the op name and index comes first, followed by quantization parameters and error metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, per the [Data Analysis](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/quantization_debugger#step_3_data_analysis) section, two additional metrics are calculated:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Range** - `scale * 255.0`, this provides the range of input values that the given layer should accept. Ideally, this value should be less than 255. Larger values could cause quantization problems at runtime. (Recall that the quantized values must fit within an `int8` data type)\n",
    "- **RMSE / scale** - `sqrt(mean_squared_error) / scale`, this value is close to `1 / sqrt(12)` (~ 0.289) when quantized distribution is similar to the original float distribution, indicating a good quantized model. The larger the value is, the more likely the layer is not being quantized well.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when viewing a quantization report, if a layer has large values in the `range` and/or `rmse/scale` columns then it could be that the model is not quantizing well. Refer to the next sections for how to fix these issues."
