    "> An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layer is a recurrent neural network (RNN) layer that learns long-term dependencies between time steps in time series and sequence data. The layer performs additive interactions, which can help improve gradient flow over long sequences during training.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> LSTMs are predominantly used to learn, process, and classify sequential data. Common LSTM applications include sentiment analysis, language modeling, speech recognition, and video analysis.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> An LSTM unit consists of a cell, an input gate, an output gate, and a forget gate. An LSTM unit can be considered as a layer of neurons in a traditional feedforward neural network, with each neuron having a hidden layer and a current state.\n",

    "So converting this CNN+LSTM model from `float32` to `int8` lost about 3% of model accuracy which is good, not great (typically, quantizing CNN-only models looses 1-2% of accuracy).\n",
    "\n",
    "The key for allowing the quantization of the [LSTM](https://keras.io/api/layers/recurrent_layers/lstm/) layer is to surround it with the [Layer Normalization](https://keras.io/api/layers/normalization_layers/layer_normalization) layer.\n",

    "Ideally, we would use the [LayerNormLSTMCell](https://www.tensorflow.org/addons/api_docs/python/tfa/rnn/LayerNormLSTMCell) which applies additional normalization to the LSTM's internal tensors, however, this layer is not currently supported by [Tensorflow-Lite Micro](https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro).\n",
