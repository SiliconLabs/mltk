    "# Cloud Logging with Weights & Biases\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial describes how to log the information generated during model development to the cloud.\n",
    "While many 3rd-party cloud solutions are available, this tutorial uses [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Weights & Biases makes it easy to track your experiments, manage & version your data, and collaborate with your team so you can focus on building the best models.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has the following benefits:\n",
    "- All model development files (trained model files, evaluation results, etc.) are saved to the cloud\n",
    "- Graphical interface for comparing different training runs\n",
    "- Sort training runs by custom configuration values to see which has the most benefit\n",
    "- View model training status from anywhere \n",
    "- Email alerts for when model training completes\n",
    "- Automatically generate model report (interactive webpage or PDF)\n",
    "- Monitor GPU and CPU usage during model training\n",

    "## Basic Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic flow for logging information to the cloud is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a Weights & Biases [account](https://app.wandb.ai/login?signup=true)\n",
    "2. Install the MLTK, see the [Installation Guide](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/installation.html#standard-python-package):  \n",
    "   ```shell\n",
    "   pip install silabs-mltk\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Install the [Weights & Biases](https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart) python package:   \n",
    "   ```shell\n",
    "   pip install wandb\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "4. Log into your wandb account using the command:  \n",
    "   ```shell\n",
    "   wandb login\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "5. Define your MLTK [model specification]() and extend the [WeightsAndBiasesMixin](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/python_api/mltk_model/weights_and_biases_mixin.html), e.g.:  \n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import mltk.core as mltk_core\n",
    "\n",
    "   class MyModel(\n",
    "      mltk_core.MltkModel,\n",
    "      mltk_core.TrainMixin,\n",
    "      mltk_core.DatasetMixin,\n",
    "      mltk_core.EvaluateClassifierMixin,\n",
    "      mltk_core.WeightsAndBiasesMixin\n",
    "   ):\n",
    "      pass\n",
    "   my_model = MyModel()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "6. [Train](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/guides/model_training.html) your model with the command:  \n",
    "   ```shell\n",
    "   mltk train <model name> --post\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Where `--post` tells the MLTK to enable the [WeightsAndBiasesMixin](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/python_api/mltk_model/weights_and_biases_mixin.html)\n",
    "7. Optionally [profile](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/guides/model_profiler.html) your model with the command:    \n",
    "   ```shell\n",
    "   mltk profile <model name> --accelerator mvp --device --post\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Where `--post` tells the MLTK to enable the [WeightsAndBiasesMixin](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/python_api/mltk_model/weights_and_biases_mixin.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it! This will train (and optionally profile) the model and all relevant information will automatically be logged to the [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai) cloud."

    "\n",
    "The [WeightsAndBiasesMixin](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/python_api/mltk_model/weights_and_biases_mixin.html) manages all of the details of initializing the wandb session and automatically logging the relavant information to the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Default Data\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the following information is logged to the cloud:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Model specification](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/guides/model_specification.html) - The Python script that defines your model\n",
    "- [Model archive](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/guides/model_archive.html) - ZIP file containing the trained model files \n",
    "- [Model summary](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/guides/model_summary.html) - Basic informaation about the model\n",
    "- Dataset summary - Basic information about the dataset used for training and evaluation\n",
    "- [Training history](https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/python/integrations/keras/wandbcallback) - Learn rate, accuracy, loss, etc.\n",
    "- [Evaluation results](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/guides/model_evaluation.html) - Precision, recall, ROC, etc.\n",
    "- [Profiling results](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/guides/model_profiler.html) - Inference/s, RAM and flash usage, etc.\n",
    "- System usage - GPU, CPU, disk, memory utilization, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Any custom data can also be stored in the cloud using:\n",
    "- [WeightsAndBiasesMixin.wandb_log()](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/python_api/mltk_model/weights_and_biases_mixin.html#mltk.core.WeightsAndBiasesMixin.wandb_log) - post custom logging information\n",
    "- [WeightsAndBiasesMixin.wandb_save()](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/python_api/mltk_model/weights_and_biases_mixin.html#mltk.core.WeightsAndBiasesMixin.wandb_save) - upload a file\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, these APIs call the wandb APIs:\n",

    "\n",
    "The MLTK supports training via [SSH](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/guides/model_training_via_ssh.html).\n",
    "This feature allows for model training in the cloud which can greatly reduce model training time.  \n",

    "\n",
    "The following is needed to enable logging to [Weight & Biases](https://wandb.ai) while training in the cloud:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Obtain your wandb [API Key](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/dagster#how-to-get-an-api-key):  \n",
    "   a. [Log in to W&B](https://wandb.ai/login)  \n",
    "   b. Collect your API key by navigating to the [authorization page](https://wandb.ai/authorize)\n",
    "2. Create/modify the [~/.mltk/user_settings.yaml](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/other/settings_file.html) file and add:  \n",
    "   ```yaml\n",
    "   ssh:\n",
    "      startup_cmds:\n",
    "      - pip install wandb plotly\n",
    "      - wandb login <API KEY> \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   where `<API KEY>` is your API key from step 1\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it! When you model trains on the cloud machine, it will also log to the Weights & Biases cloud.  \n",
    "This is especially useful when used in conjunction with the [Alerts](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/alert) feature of W&B so you can be notified when training completes."

    "- [Collaborative Reports](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/reports) - Reports let you organize, embed and automate visualizations, describe your findings, share updates with collaborators, and more.\n",
    "- [Alerts](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/alert) - Send alerts, triggered from your Python code, to your Slack or email\n",
    "- [Storing Artifacts](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts) -  track datasets, models, dependencies, and results through each step of your machine learning pipeline. Artifacts make it easy to get a complete and auditable history of changes to your files."
