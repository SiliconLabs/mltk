    "The profiler reports that it takes 239 milliseconds to execute the model one time. Unfortunately, this is likely too slow to fit within our hardware constraints. For this model to work, it should really execute in less than 120ms. This is necessary because we also need to account for the time required to generate a spectrogram (which is _not_ included in the profiler's reported number). We need to process the generated spectrogram in the ML model multiple times so that we can average enough model predictions to have confidence that a keyword is actually detected.
