    "## Quick start\n",
    "\n",
    "To quickly get this demo running, perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Install](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/installation.html#standard-python-package) the MLTK Python package \n",
    "2. Obtain a [BRD2601](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/efr32xg24-dev-kit) development kit\n",
    "3. Obtain an analog [speaker](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3885) and connect the signal to the pin 9 of the development board (as well as the ground and power signals)\n",
    "4. Install [Segger J-Link](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink) (if necessary) which provides the drivers necessary for programming the development board\n",
    "5. Run the following MLTK command to program the firmware application and \"Alexa\" ML model to the development board:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   mltk program_app mltk_audio_classifier-audio_io-brd2601-mvp --model keyword_spotting_alexa\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Download the Python script [alexa_demo.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SiliconLabs/mltk/master/cpp/shared/apps/audio_classifier/python/alexa_demo/alexa_demo.py) to your local PC\n",
    "7. From the MLTK Python environment, run the script and follow the instructions for obtaining the AVS cloud credentials:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   python alexa_demo.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. At this point, you should now be able to speak commands into the develop board's microphone, which will be sent to the AVS cloud, and responses will be returned to the dev board's connected speaker.  \n",
    "   Try saying some of the commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Alexa, what time is it?\n",
    "   - Alexa, tell me a joke\n",
    "   - Alexa, what's 1+1?\n",

    "\n",
    "__NOTE:__ By default, the UART BAUD rate is 115200 which is too slow for larger Alexa responses, see the [Increase Baud Rate](#increase-the-baud-rate) section below for details how to increase the BAUD rate so responses from AVS may be properly played."

    "### Create the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important part of developing a machine learning model is acquiring a __representative__ dataset.  \n",
    "A good, __representative__ dataset should have numerous (e.g. 10k-1M) \"positive\" samples (i.e. audio clips of people saying the word \"Alexa\")\n",
    "and numerous \"negative\" samples (i.e. audio clips of people saying other words besides \"Alexa\").\n",
    "The larger and more diverse the dataset is, the better the model will likely perform in the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Synthetic dataset generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, the dataset should contain samples of 10k+ people saying the word \"Alexa\". However, creating such a dataset can be very expensive and time-consuming.\n",
    "An alternative approach is to synthetically generate the dataset using cloud-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) services.  \n",
    "Refer to the [Synthetic Audio Dataset Generation](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/mltk/tutorials/synthetic_audio_dataset_generation.html) tutorial for how an \"Alexa\" dataset can be generated using the Google, Microsoft, and Amazon Clouds.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"Negative\" class\n",
    "\n",
    "While having a large and diverse \"positive\" class (i.e. samples of people saying \"Alexa\") is important, it is also important to have a large \"negative\" class.\n",
    "This way, the ML model learns not only how to detect the \"Alexa\" keyword, but also how to reject words and noises that sound similar to the \"Alexa\" keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here [synthetic audio dataset generation](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/mltk/tutorials/synthetic_audio_dataset_generation.html) is useful as keywords that sound similar to \"alexa\" (e.g. alice, alexia, etc.) can be generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other large, publicly available audio datasets can also be used for the \"negative\" class samples:  \n",
    "- [MLCommons Multilingual Spoken Words](https://mlcommons.org/en/multilingual-spoken-words) - A large and growing audio dataset of spoken words in 50 languages for academic research and commercial applications in keyword spotting and spoken term search, licensed under CC-BY 4.0\n",
    "- [Mozilla Common Voice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets) - An open source, multi-language dataset of voices that anyone can use to train speech-enabled applications\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class balance\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"positive\" and \"negative\" classes should have approximately the same number of samples.\n",
    "If one class has substantially more samples then the model may not adequately learn the intricacies of each class.\n",
    "To help account for this, Tensorflow has the concept of [class weights](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/imbalanced_data#class_weights). The [MLTK Model](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/python_api/mltk_model/index.html) also provides a [class_weights](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/python_api/mltk_model/dataset_mixin.html#mltk.core.DatasetMixin.class_weights) property to automatically balance the classes during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, class weights may not work for substantially imbalanced (4x or more) datasets, which is the case for the [Keyword Spotting - Alexa](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/python_api/models/siliconlabs/keyword_spotting_alexa.html) model.\n",
    "In this model's case, the \"negative\" class has 10x more samples than the \"positive\" class.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help account for this, the training script forces the \"negative\" class to have 2x the samples of the \"positive\" class. Then during training, all of the \"negative\" samples are randomly shuffled and only a subset is used for each epoch.\n",
    "In this way, the \"negative\" and \"positive\" classes are approximately balanced, yet the model \"sees\" all of the \"negative\" samples through the course of the full model training process."

    "### Select the model architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Acquiring a representative dataset is the most important step in ML model development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important step is defining a model architecture. A good model architecture should have the following characteristics:  \n",
    "- __Able to learn the dataset well__ - Ensures it will be robust in the field\n",
    "- __Able to fit within the target hardware's constraints__ - The model must be small enough to fit within the RAM/Flash memories\n",
    "- __Able to execute within the application's time requirements__ - The model's inference time (on the target hardware) must be low so that the application is responsive (i.e. The model should execute quickly so that there is little delay after saying \"Alexa\")\n",

    "\n",
    "Typically, the larger the spectrogram's dimensions the better its quality. However, increasing the spectrogram dimensions also increases the input size to the ML model which increases the processing time on the embedded hardware.\n",
